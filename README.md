### Introduction

This is a simple program to create Personal Training Plans, it was created for a friend who loves to make training plans for me and other colleagues. In it we can create exercises, weekly routines, create different users, and save your training plan in a MySQL database. We will also be able to print the plans in PDF and soon I will upload an android project to be able to load the plan from the mobile with a username and password.
The program is typed in Spanish, but I hope it won't be a problem, in any case dont hesitate to contact me ;)
